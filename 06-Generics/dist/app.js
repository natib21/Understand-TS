// Generics 
// What are Generics ?
//    in TypeScript (and other programming languages
//  like Java and C#) are a way to create reusable
//  and flexible components, such as functions, classes,
//  and interfaces, that can work with any data type while 
//  still enforcing type safety. Generics allow you 
//  to define types that can be used with different data types
//  without losing the benefits of type checking.
